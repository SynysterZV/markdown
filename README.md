**Frisk** is the playable character and main protagonist of
*[Undertale](Undertale "wikilink")*. After Frisk falls into the
[Underground](Underground "wikilink"), they embark on a journey to
return to the [surface](surface "wikilink"). Frisk is the last of the
[eight humans](Eight_Humans "wikilink") to fall into the Underground
after traveling to [Mount Ebott](Surface#Mount_Ebott "wikilink"). Frisk
is not the \"[fallen human](Chara "wikilink")\" whom the
[player](player "wikilink") names at the beginning of the game,
but Frisk\'s name is only revealed in the [True Pacifist
Route](True_Pacifist_Route "wikilink").

## Profile

### Appearance

Frisk is a human child who wears a blue shirt with pinkish purple
colored stripes, blue pants, and brown shoes. They have medium-length
straight brown hair, short and choppy bangs, and a blank expression.
Though Frisk does not show much expression in the overworld, NPCs often
describe Frisk\'s expressions.[^1] Just like the first human, they have
no stated gender and are solely referred to as \"they\" throughout the
game.

### Personality

Frisk\'s personality is usually ambiguous, allowing the player to
project any personality onto Frisk. However, the narration that
describes Frisk\'s actions occasionally changes depending on their
[LOVE](Stats#LOVE "wikilink"). Frisk speaks to NPCs throughout the game,
especially when ACTing in [encounters](encounter "wikilink"), but the
exact dialogue is shown only when the game gives multiple dialogue
options. NPCs\' dialogue boxes display \"\...\" to show that the NPC is
listening to Frisk,[^2] and some NPCs respond to questions that Frisk
asks.[^3]

Depending on their actions, players can interpret Frisk as merciful and
kind or merciless and violent. Some NPCs emphasize Frisk\'s kindness,
understanding, and grace in the epilogue.[^4] Frisk is obedient and only
disallows player input when they follow someone else\'s instructions,
such as when Sans tells them to hide behind the conveniently-shaped
lamp.

### Abilities

Frisk\'s [determination](determination "wikilink") grants the power to
[SAVE](SAVE "wikilink")[^5] and heal at [SAVE
Points](SAVE_Point "wikilink"). This power emerged when Frisk first
awoke in the [Ruins](Ruins "wikilink"). Frisk can reload the SAVE file
to repeat events that occur after it, but NPCs\' memories are not
completely erased unless a True Reset occurs. After the True Pacifist
ending, [Flowey](Flowey "wikilink")\'s dialogue implies that Frisk is
not the being who is manipulating SAVE files.

Frisk is the only character who is ever shown using
[items](:Category:Items "wikilink") or gaining EXP.

## Main Story {#main_story}

### Neutral Route {#neutral_route}

Flowey attempts to kill Frisk after he pretends to offer honest
advice.[^6] [Toriel](Toriel "wikilink") intervenes, hits Flowey with
fire magic, and serves as a guide to the Ruins. At the end of a long
room, Toriel asks Frisk to wait for her to return and states that she
has errands to do. To be safe, Toriel gives Frisk a [cell
phone](Cell_Phone "wikilink") to call her with.

Frisk travels through [the remaining puzzles](Ruins/Puzzles "wikilink")
in the Ruins and eventually arrives at Toriel\'s home. They ask Toriel
\"how to exit the RUINS,\" which prompts Toriel to destroy the Ruins\'s
exit. Toriel then battles Frisk because she wants them to prove that
they can survive outside of the Ruins.[^7]

Then, Frisk meets [Sans](Sans "wikilink") and
[Papyrus](Papyrus "wikilink") in [Snowdin
Forest](Snowdin_Forest "wikilink"). The brothers set up [traps and
puzzles](Snowdin/Puzzles "wikilink") in an attempt to capture Frisk.
After passing through [Snowdin](Snowdin "wikilink"), Papyrus battles
Frisk.

[Undyne](Undyne "wikilink"), the head of the [Royal
Guard](:Category:Royal_Guard "wikilink"), pursues Frisk throughout
[Waterfall](Waterfall "wikilink"). [Monster Kid](Monster_Kid "wikilink")
often saves Frisk from Undyne by accident because they are so excited to
see Undyne in action.[^8] After a chase scene, Undyne destroys a bridge
that Frisk is standing on, and Frisk falls into the [Garbage
Dump](Garbage_Dump "wikilink"). Before they get up, they recall a memory
from the first human.[^9] In the garbage dump, [Mad
Dummy](Mad_Dummy "wikilink") battles Frisk after accusing them of
mistreating their cousin, [Dummy](Dummy "wikilink"), in the Ruins. At
the end of Waterfall, Undyne battles Frisk after she gives an abridged
monologue atop a crag.

After entering [Hotland](Hotland "wikilink"), Frisk enters a
[lab](lab "wikilink") and meets [Alphys](Alphys "wikilink") and
[Mettaton](Mettaton "wikilink"). Alphys tells Frisk that she is not a
bad guy,[^10] and Mettaton interrupts them with a [quiz
show](Hotland/Puzzles#"Quiz_Show" "wikilink"). Alphys gives Frisk an
upgraded cell phone after the quiz show concludes. She guides Frisk
through Hotland and the [CORE](CORE "wikilink"), helping them solve
puzzles and evade Mettaton. Before his battle at the end of the CORE,
Mettaton reveals that Alphys had created all of the traps in Hotland in
an attempt to endear herself to Frisk.[^11] He then transforms into
Mettaton EX and battles Frisk.

While passing through [New Home](New_Home "wikilink"), the capital of
the Underground, Frisk learns the story of
[Asgore](Asgore_Dreemurr "wikilink") and Toriel\'s children from passing
monsters. Then, Sans judges Frisk in the [Last
Corridor](Last_Corridor "wikilink") and explains the meaning of LOVE and
[EXP](Stats#EXP "wikilink"). He also emphasizes Frisk\'s importance in
the fate of the world.[^12]

#### Escape

![The battle against Asgore, in which Frisk is initially unable to offer
him
mercy.](ASGORE_soundtrack.png "fig:The battle against Asgore, in which Frisk is initially unable to offer him mercy.")
Frisk enters the Throne Room and finds Asgore, who tries to make small
talk, only to realize their fated confrontation. The two walk to the
Barrier and Asgore gives Frisk one last opportunity to leave before
fighting.

Just before the fight, Asgore shows the six collected human
[SOULs](SOUL "wikilink"), preparing the containment process after the
battle. Right before the fight starts, Asgore destroys the MERCY button
with his trident, making it impossible to spare or flee. However, at the
fight\'s conclusion, Frisk can explicitly choose whether to spare or
kill Asgore. Regardless of the choice made, Flowey appears, destroys
Asgore\'s SOUL and takes the human SOULs. The game then abruptly closes.

After reopening the game, Frisk finds that Flowey has saved his own game
over the SAVE file, having gained the power to do so with the stolen
human SOULs. Loading Flowey\'s game, Frisk confronts a [powered up
Flowey](Photoshop_Flowey "wikilink") and defiantly steps forward,
entering an initially hopeless battle with him.

After Frisk calls for help several times, the stolen SOULs begin to
revolt: first, they heal Frisk, and then they weaken Flowey, leaving him
vulnerable to destruction. After reducing his HP to 0 and listening to
his monologue, the SOULs remove Flowey\'s ability to SAVE or LOAD. After
this, the SOULs leave Frisk and Flowey alone. At this point, there is an
option to kill or spare a weakened Flowey before leaving the
Underground, return to the surface, and end their journey.

![Sans\'s phone call introduction in most neutral
routes.](An_Ending_soundtrack.png "fig:Sans's phone call introduction in most neutral routes.")
After leaving the Underground, Frisk receives a call from Sans, who
leaves a message about what happened to the Underground after Asgore
died. This varies based on what monsters were killed and what
friendships were completed.

### True Pacifist Route {#true_pacifist_route}

To complete the True Pacifist Route, Frisk must have first completed the
Neutral Route.

If Frisk has completed the Neutral Route without gaining any EXP or LV
(i.e. without killing anyone), it is possible to backtrack in the
existing SAVE file to complete any missing friendships, then achieve the
True Pacifist ending.

If Frisk acquires any EXP or LV, they have to reset the game to reach
the True Pacifist Ending.

#### Friendships

While Frisk befriends many of the monsters in the Underground, only the
Undyne, Papyrus, and Alphys friendships are required to achieve the True
Pacifist Ending.

Frisk gains Papyrus\'s friendship by visiting him at his home and
hanging out or dating him.

If Frisk chooses to give Undyne some water after being pursued, Undyne
can be befriended (if they have not gained any EXP beforehand).
Otherwise, a reset is needed to achieve Undyne\'s trust and friendship.
Frisk visits Undyne with Papyrus\'s help, and Undyne gets \"revenge\" by
trying to befriend Frisk and become \"besties\", setting her house on
fire in the process. She tries to fight Frisk to regain honor but
realizes that Frisk is a \"wimpy loser with a big heart\" just like
Asgore and decides to be friends.

Undyne, having been encouraged to send a love letter to Alphys, gives
the letter to Frisk, who delivers it to Alphys. This results in a date
sequence with Alphys in which she and Undyne realize their feelings for
each other and Alphys begins to come to terms with her past mistakes.

After befriending Alphys, Papyrus recommends traveling to Alphys\'s lab.
In the lab, there is a letter on the floor that, when picked up, reads a
monologue and the instructions needed to proceed to learn \"the truth.\"
Walking through the bathroom door reveals an elevator which goes down to
the [True Lab](True_Lab "wikilink") after a malfunction.

Frisk proceeds to explore the True Lab and along the way learns of
Alphys\'s failed experiments
([amalgamates](:Category:Amalgamates "wikilink")) with determination and
also about the origin of Flowey. After exploring the True Lab and
talking to Alphys, she gains the confidence to reveal the truth about
her experiments to the rest of the Underground. While attempting to
leave, Frisk receives a phone call in the elevator from an unknown
voice. The elevator immediately and forcibly brings Frisk to New Home.

#### Barrier

![Flowey restrains Frisk\'s friends before the final
battle.](Flowey_screenshot_captured_monsters.png "fig:Flowey restrains Frisk's friends before the final battle.")
After returning to the throne room and confronting Asgore again, the
pre-fight dialogue is interrupted by Toriel, who stops Asgore from
fighting Frisk. Toriel is immediately followed by the other main
characters who encourage everyone to get along. However, in a surprise
twist, Papyrus reveals that it was \"a tiny flower\" who told him to
bring everyone there.

Immediately after this reveal, Flowey appears, having again stolen the
SOULs of the six other humans. He attempts to kill Frisk, but Undyne,
Toriel, Alphys, Asgore, Sans, and Papyrus use their power to block
Flowey\'s finishing blows. Directly after this, all of the
Underground\'s monsters arrive to encourage Frisk in the fight against
Flowey. However, Flowey reveals that this is what he wanted all along so
that he could absorb the souls of all the monsters in the Underground
along with the six human SOULs.

![ASRIEL DREEMURR\'s intro right before the final
battle.](Asriel_Dreemurr_screenshot_introduction.gif "fig:ASRIEL DREEMURR's intro right before the final battle.")
Due to the immense power gained from the six human SOULs and all of the
monster SOULs, Flowey can transform into his true form, and just before
the fight begins it is revealed that he is actually [Asriel
Dreemurr](Asriel_Dreemurr "wikilink").

During this fight, Frisk is invincible, and any hit that would normally
result in death instead causes the heart to split, but reform back
together. The first time this happens, it is accompanied by the text
\"but it refused.\" After stalling for long enough, Asriel transforms
again. At this point, Frisk can feel the souls of Toriel, Asgore,
Alphys, Undyne, Papyrus, and Sans within Asriel and the ACT button
changes to SAVE to represent the act of freeing everyone\'s souls. This
is accomplished by completing a short sequence of ACT options to restore
the memory of each lost soul after selecting the said lost soul of a
chosen character.

After saving each monster, Frisk realizes that there is still one more
person to save. After choosing to save \"someone else,\" Asriel\'s
memories of the first human (who strongly resembled Frisk) begin to play
in a slideshow style. It is then revealed this \"someone else\" is
Asriel himself. After this, Asriel starts to feel the love the monsters
feel for Frisk through the souls he has absorbed, and slowly loses the
will to fight as he is overcome with his fear of dying alone.

After reverting to his child form, Asriel learns Frisk\'s name. He
apologizes for hurting everybody, and Frisk can choose to forgive or not
forgive Asriel. Regardless of the choice made, Asriel destroys the
barrier using the power of all of the SOULs before releasing them.
Knowing that he will turn back to a flower without the power of the
SOULs to sustain him, Asriel says one last goodbye to Frisk before
leaving. At this point, there is a choice to hug Asriel or do nothing.

#### Freedom

![The start menu after the barrier has been
broken.](Menu_(Full)_soundtrack.png "fig:The start menu after the barrier has been broken.")
After the scene with Asriel finishes, Frisk wakes up in front of Toriel,
Sans, Papyrus, Undyne, Alphys and Asgore. While the monsters remember
little about Flowey and nothing about his incarnation as Asriel, they do
know Frisk\'s name. At this point, Frisk can backtrack through the
Underground and talk to the other monsters, before returning to the
surface.

Backtracking to the very first room in Undertale reveals that Asriel is
tending to the flowers. Asriel asks about Frisk\'s desire to travel up
Mt. Ebott in the first place. Receiving no answer, Asriel lists off
foolishness or fate as possible motives, but comes to the conclusion
that \"only you (Frisk) know the answer.\"

![Photo shown if Frisk says that they have places to
go.](True_Pacifist_Route_screenshot_ending_photo.png "fig:Photo shown if Frisk says that they have places to go.")
After passing through the final door to the surface, Frisk leaves the
Underground with friends. Asgore offers Frisk the chance to be the
monsters\' ambassador to the humans. Most of the main monster cast then
leave, except for Toriel, who asks about Frisk\'s plans. At this point,
Frisk can choose to stay with Toriel or to go elsewhere.

After choosing to stay with Toriel, the ending scene shows Toriel
bringing a slice of pie to Frisk\'s bedroom. Otherwise, if Frisk has
\"places to go,\" the game ends with a group photo of the main monster
cast with Frisk in the middle.

## Trivia

![An earlier version of Frisk\'s
sprite.](Frisk_overworld_beta.gif "An earlier version of Frisk's sprite.")

-   The word \"frisk\" can mean several things:
    -   To \"frisk\" means to skip or leap playfully, or to pat down on
        someone, looking for a hidden item.
    -   \"Frisk\" is the Swedish and Norwegian word for \"healthy,\" and
        the Danish word for \"fresh.\"
    -   \"Frisky\" means \"playful and full of energy.\"
-   [Naming](Names "wikilink") the fallen human \"Frisk\" initiates
    [Hard Mode](Hard_Mode "wikilink").
-   In a joke thread on Starmen.net, Toby Fox posted early files from
    *Undertale* saying they were from an *EarthBound* hack called
    \"UnderBound 2.\"[^14]
    -   It was said that Frisk was a young androgynous child who was the
        step-cousin of \"Squeezo\" from the non-existent *EarthBound*
        hack, \"UnderBound.\"
    -   Frisk was also shown to have black outlines with black hair and
        shoes compared to the lighter brown seen in the final version of
        the game. The artbook reveals this was changed because the
        sprite didn\'t show up on the game\'s dark backgrounds that
        well.
    -   It was also mentioned that Frisk\'s love interest was a female
        Cuban cigar.[^15]
-   While Frisk is allergic to [Temmie](Temmie "wikilink"),[^16] this is
    not true of the other furry residents of the Underground.
-   Frisk appears to be left-handed. Evidence includes:
    -   Holding the umbrella and glass of water using their left hand.
    -   The slicing attack animation curving to the right, implying that
        force was carried from the left to the right during the attack.
        -   Most fatality battle sprites display steep slashes from top
            left to bottom right, a pattern not commonly made by someone
            who is right-handed.
-   Out of all the humans that fell to the Underground, Frisk is the
    only human to survive the adventure.
-   When hugging Asriel, stripes appear on Frisk\'s shirt sleeves.
