**Ohio** `{{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Ohio.ogg|oʊ|ˈ|h|aɪ|oʊ}}`{=mediawiki} is
a [state](U.S._state "wikilink") in the
[Midwestern](Midwestern_United_States "wikilink") region of the [United
States](United_States "wikilink"). Of the [fifty
states](List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States "wikilink"),
it is the [34th-largest by
area](List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_area "wikilink"), and with
a population of nearly 11.7 million, is the [seventh-most
populous](List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population "wikilink")
and [tenth-most densely
populated](List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population_density "wikilink").
The state\'s capital and [largest
city](List_of_cities_in_Ohio "wikilink") is
[Columbus](Columbus,_Ohio "wikilink"), with the [Columbus metro
area](Columbus_metropolitan_area,_Ohio "wikilink"), [Greater
Cincinnati](Cincinnati_metropolitan_area "wikilink"), and [Greater
Cleveland](Greater_Cleveland "wikilink") being the [largest metropolitan
areas](List_of_metropolitan_statistical_areas "wikilink"). Ohio is
bordered by [Lake Erie](Lake_Erie "wikilink") to the north,
[Pennsylvania](Pennsylvania "wikilink") to the east, [West
Virginia](West_Virginia "wikilink") to the southeast,
[Kentucky](Kentucky "wikilink") to the southwest,
[Indiana](Indiana "wikilink") to the west, and
[Michigan](Michigan "wikilink") to the northwest. Ohio is historically
known as the \"Buckeye State\" after its [Ohio buckeye
trees](Aesculus_glabra "wikilink"), and Ohioans are also known as
\"Buckeyes\".[^1]

The state takes its name from the [Ohio River](Ohio_River "wikilink"),
whose name in turn originated from the
[Seneca](Seneca_language "wikilink") word *ohiːyo{{\'}}*, meaning \"good
river\", \"great river\", or \"large creek\".[^2][^3][^4] Ohio arose
from the lands west of Appalachia that were contested from colonial
times through the [Northwest Indian
Wars](Northwest_Indian_War "wikilink") of the late 18th century. It was
partitioned from the resulting [Northwest
Territory](Northwest_Territory "wikilink"), which was the first frontier
of the new United States, and became the 17th state admitted to the
Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the [Northwest
Ordinance](Northwest_Ordinance "wikilink").[^5][^6] Ohio was the first
post-colonial [free state](Slave_states_and_free_states "wikilink")
admitted to the union, and became one of the earliest and most
influential industrial powerhouses in the 20th century; although it has
[transitioned](Post-industrial_economy "wikilink") to a more
[information](Knowledge_economy "wikilink") and [service based
economy](Service_economy "wikilink") in the 21st century, Ohio remains
an industrial state, ranking seventh in GDP as of 2019,[^7] with the
third largest manufacturing sector and second largest automobile
production.[^8]

The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the
[governor](List_of_Governors_of_Ohio "wikilink"); the legislative
branch, consisting of the bicameral [Ohio General
Assembly](Ohio_General_Assembly "wikilink"); and the judicial branch,
led by the state [Supreme Court](Supreme_Court_of_Ohio "wikilink"). Ohio
occupies 16 seats in the [United States House of
Representatives](United_States_House_of_Representatives "wikilink").[^9]
The state is known for its status as both a [swing
state](swing_state "wikilink") and a [bellwether](bellwether "wikilink")
in national elections.[^10] Seven [presidents of the United
States](presidents_of_the_United_States "wikilink") have [come from
Ohio](List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_home_state "wikilink"),
the most of any state; this has led to it receiving the moniker \"the
Mother of Presidents\".[^11]

}}`{=mediawiki} Ohio\'s geographic location has proven to be an asset
for economic growth and expansion. Because Ohio links the Northeast to
the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders
along its well-developed highways. Ohio has the nation\'s 10th largest
highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America\'s
population and 70% of North America\'s manufacturing capacity.[^12] To
the north, Ohio has `{{convert|312|mi|km}}`{=mediawiki} of coastline
with Lake Erie,[^13] which allows for numerous cargo ports such as
Cleveland and Toledo. Ohio\'s southern border is defined by the [Ohio
River](Ohio_River "wikilink"). Ohio\'s neighbors are
[Pennsylvania](Pennsylvania "wikilink") to the east,
[Michigan](Michigan "wikilink") to the northwest, [Lake
Erie](Lake_Erie "wikilink") to the north, [Indiana](Indiana "wikilink")
to the west, [Kentucky](Kentucky "wikilink") on the south, and [West
Virginia](West_Virginia "wikilink") on the southeast. Ohio\'s borders
were defined by [metes and bounds](metes_and_bounds "wikilink") in the
[Enabling Act of 1802](Enabling_Act_of_1802 "wikilink") as follows:
`{{quote |Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line, on the south by the Ohio River, to the mouth of the [[Great Miami River]], on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid, and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of [[Lake Michigan]], running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line, and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid.}}`{=mediawiki}

Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river itself
belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. In 1980, the [U.S. Supreme
Court](U.S._Supreme_Court "wikilink") held that, based on the wording of
the cessation of territory by [Virginia](Virginia "wikilink") (which at
the time included what is now Kentucky and West Virginia), the boundary
between Ohio and Kentucky (and, by implication, West Virginia) is the
northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792.[^14] Ohio
has only that portion of the river between the river\'s 1792 low-water
mark and the present high-water mark.

The border with Michigan has also changed, as a result of the [Toledo
War](Toledo_War "wikilink"), to angle slightly northeast to the north
shore of the mouth of the Maumee River.

Much of Ohio features [glaciated till
plains](Glacial_till_plains_(Ohio) "wikilink"), with an exceptionally
flat area in the northwest being known as the [Great Black
Swamp](Great_Black_Swamp "wikilink"). This glaciated region in the
northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first
by a belt known as the [glaciated Allegheny
Plateau](glaciated_Allegheny_Plateau "wikilink"), and then by another
belt known as the [unglaciated Allegheny
Plateau](unglaciated_Allegheny_Plateau "wikilink"). Most of Ohio is of
low relief, but the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau [features rugged hills
and forests](Appalachian_Ohio "wikilink").

The rugged southeastern quadrant of Ohio, stretching in an outward
bow-like arc along the Ohio River from the West [Virginia
Panhandle](Northern_Panhandle_of_West_Virginia "wikilink") to the
outskirts of Cincinnati, forms a distinct
[socio-economic](Socioeconomics "wikilink") unit. Geologically similar
to parts of West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, this area\'s
coal mining legacy, dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing
establishments, and distinctive regional dialect set this section off
from the rest of the state. In 1965 the [United States
Congress](United_States_Congress "wikilink") passed the Appalachian
Regional Development Act, an attempt to \"address the persistent poverty
and growing economic despair of the Appalachian Region\".[^15] This act
defines 29 Ohio counties as part of Appalachia.[^16] While 1/3 of
Ohio\'s land mass is part of the federally defined Appalachian region,
only 12.8% of Ohioans live there (1.476 million people.)[^17]
![](Map_of_Ohio_NA.png "fig:Map_of_Ohio_NA.png")

Significant [rivers](List_of_rivers_of_Ohio "wikilink") within the state
include the [Cuyahoga River](Cuyahoga_River "wikilink"), [Great Miami
River](Great_Miami_River "wikilink"), [Maumee
River](Maumee_River "wikilink"), [Muskingum
River](Muskingum_River "wikilink"), and [Scioto
River](Scioto_River "wikilink"). The rivers in the northern part of the
state drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via [Lake
Erie](Lake_Erie "wikilink") and the [St. Lawrence
River](St._Lawrence_River "wikilink"), and the rivers in the southern
part of the state drain into the [Gulf of
Mexico](Gulf_of_Mexico "wikilink") via the [Ohio
River](Ohio_River "wikilink") and then the
[Mississippi](Mississippi_River "wikilink").

The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great
Miami River in 1913. Known as the [Great Dayton
Flood](Great_Dayton_Flood "wikilink"), the entire [Miami
River](Great_Miami_River "wikilink") watershed flooded, including the
downtown business district of [Dayton](Dayton,_Ohio "wikilink"). As a
result, the [Miami Conservancy
District](Miami_Conservancy_District "wikilink") was created as the
first major flood plain engineering project in Ohio and the United
States.[^18]

[Grand Lake St. Marys](Grand_Lake_St._Marys "wikilink") in the
west-central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for
[canals](canal "wikilink") in the canal-building era of 1820--1850. This
body of water, over `{{convert|20|sqmi|km2}}`{=mediawiki}, was the
largest artificial lake in the world when completed in 1845.[^19]
[Ohio\'s canal-building projects](:Category:Canals_in_Ohio "wikilink")
were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states.
Some cities, such as Dayton, owe their industrial emergence to location
on canals, and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk
freight of the state.

### Climate

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Climate change in Ohio}}
```
![Köppen climate types in Ohio now showing majority as humid
subtropical](Ohio_Köppen.svg "Köppen climate types in Ohio now showing majority as humid subtropical")

The climate of Ohio is a [humid continental
climate](humid_continental_climate "wikilink") ([Köppen climate
classification](Köppen_climate_classification "wikilink") *Dfa/Dfb*)
throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of
Ohio\'s [Bluegrass region](Bluegrass_region "wikilink") section, which
are located on the northern periphery of the [humid subtropical
climate](humid_subtropical_climate "wikilink") (*Cfa*) and [Upland
South](Upland_South "wikilink") region of the United States. Summers are
typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally
range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round.
Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are
typically fewer [tornado](tornado "wikilink") reports in Ohio than in
states located in what is known as the [Tornado
Alley](Tornado_Alley "wikilink"). Severe [lake effect
snowstorms](lake_effect_snow "wikilink") are also not uncommon on the
southeast shore of [Lake Erie](Lake_Erie "wikilink"), which is located
in an area designated as the [Snowbelt](Snowbelt "wikilink").

Although predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate
flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with
more southern ranges, such as the [blackjack
oak](blackjack_oak "wikilink"), *Quercus marilandica*, are found at
their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing
this climatic transition from a subtropical to continental climate,
several plants such as the Southern magnolia *([Magnolia
grandiflora](Magnolia_grandiflora "wikilink"))*, [Albizia
julibrissin](Albizia_julibrissin "wikilink") (mimosa), [Crape
Myrtle](Crape_Myrtle "wikilink"), and even the occasional [Needle
Palm](Needle_Palm "wikilink") are hardy landscape materials regularly
used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the [Bluegrass
region](Bluegrass_region "wikilink") of Ohio; but these same plants will
simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting
change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on [Interstate
75](Interstate_75_in_Ohio "wikilink") from
[Cincinnati](Cincinnati "wikilink") to
[Toledo](Toledo,_Ohio "wikilink"); the observant traveler of this
diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati\'s [common wall
lizard](common_wall_lizard "wikilink"), one of the few examples of
permanent \"subtropical\" fauna in Ohio.

Due to flooding resulting in severely damaged highways, Governor [Mike
DeWine](Mike_DeWine "wikilink") declared a [state of
emergency](state_of_emergency "wikilink") in 37 Ohio counties in

#### Records

The highest recorded temperature was
`{{convert|113|F|C|lk=on}}`{=mediawiki}, near
[Gallipolis](Gallipolis,_Ohio "wikilink") on July 21, 1934.[^22] The

### Earthquakes

Although few have registered as noticeable to the average resident, more
than 200 earthquakes with a
[magnitude](Richter_magnitude_scale "wikilink") of 2.0 or higher have
occurred in Ohio since 1776.[^25] The Western Ohio Seismic Zone and a
portion of the [Southern Great Lakes Seismic
Zone](Southern_Great_Lakes_Seismic_Zone "wikilink") are located in the
state, and numerous [faults](Fault_(geology) "wikilink") lie under the
surface.[^26][^27]

The most substantial known earthquake in Ohio history was the
[Anna](Anna,_Ohio "wikilink") (Shelby County) earthquake,[^28] which
occurred on March 9, 1937. It was centered in western Ohio, and had a
magnitude of 5.4, and was of
[intensity](Mercalli_intensity_scale "wikilink") VIII.[^29]

Other significant earthquakes in Ohio include:[^30] one of magnitude 4.8
near [Lima](Lima,_Ohio "wikilink") on September 19, 1884;[^31] one of
magnitude 4.2 near [Portsmouth](Portsmouth,_Ohio "wikilink") on May 17,
1901;[^32] and one of 5.0 in [LeRoy Township in Lake
County](LeRoy_Township,_Lake_County,_Ohio "wikilink") on January 31,
1986, which continued to trigger 13 aftershocks of magnitude 0.5 to 2.4
for two months.[^33][^34]

Notable Ohio earthquakes in the 21st century include one occurring on
December 31, 2011, approximately `{{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki}
northwest of [Youngstown](Youngstown,_Ohio "wikilink"),[^35] and one
occurring on June 10, 2019, approximately
`{{convert|5|km|mi|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} north-northwest of
[Eastlake](Eastlake,_Ohio "wikilink") under [Lake
Erie](Lake_Erie "wikilink");[^36] both registered a 4.0 magnitude.

## History

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Prehistory of Ohio|History of Ohio}}
```
### Indigenous settlement {#indigenous_settlement}

![Artists conception of the [Fort Ancient](Fort_Ancient "wikilink")
[SunWatch Indian Village](SunWatch_Indian_Village "wikilink") in
[Dayton](Dayton,_Ohio "wikilink")](Sunwatch_Aerial_illustration_HRoe_2018_400px.jpg "Artists conception of the Fort Ancient SunWatch Indian Village in Dayton")

Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis
types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by [nomadic
people](Nomad "wikilink") as early as 13,000 BC.[^49] These early nomads
disappeared from Ohio by 1,000 BC.[^50] Between 1,000 and 800 BC, the
sedentary [Adena culture](Adena_culture "wikilink") emerged. The Adena
were able to establish \"semi-permanent\" villages because they
domesticated plants, including, [sunflowers](sunflowers "wikilink"), and
\"grew [squash](squash_(plant) "wikilink") and possibly
[corn](maize "wikilink")\"; with hunting and gathering, this cultivation
supported more settled, complex villages.[^51] The most notable remnant
of the Adena culture is the [Great Serpent
Mound](Great_Serpent_Mound "wikilink"), located in [Adams County,
Ohio](Adams_County,_Ohio "wikilink").[^52]
[thumb\|left\|upright=0.95\|[Iroquois](Iroquois "wikilink") conquests
during the [Beaver Wars](Beaver_Wars "wikilink") (mid-1600s), which
largely depopulated the upper and mid-[Ohio
River](Ohio_River "wikilink")
valley](File:5NationsExpansion.jpg "wikilink")

Around 100 BC, the Adena evolved into the
[Hopewell](Hopewell_tradition "wikilink") people who were also mound
builders. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated
[earthworks](Earthworks_(archaeology) "wikilink") can be found in
modern-day [Marietta](Marietta,_Ohio "wikilink"),
[Newark](Newark,_Ohio "wikilink"), and
[Circleville](Circleville,_Ohio "wikilink").[^53] They were also a
prolific trading society, their trading network spanning a third of the
continent.[^54] The Hopewell disappeared from the Ohio Valley about
600 AD. The [Mississippian Culture](Mississippian_Culture "wikilink")
rose as the Hopewell Culture declined. Many Siouan-speaking peoples from
the plains and east coast claim them as ancestors and say they lived
throughout the Ohio region until approximately the 13th century.[^55]

There were three other cultures contemporaneous with the Mississippians:
the [Fort Ancient](Fort_Ancient "wikilink") people, the [Whittlesey
Focus people](Whittlesey_Focus_people "wikilink")[^56] and the
[Monongahela Culture](Monongahela_Culture "wikilink").[^57] All three
cultures disappeared in the 17th century. Their origins are unknown. The
Shawnees may have absorbed the Fort Ancient people.[^58] It is also
possible that the Monongahela held no land in Ohio during the Colonial
Era. The Mississippian Culture were close to and traded extensively with
the Fort Ancient people.

Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive
tactics of the [Iroquois
Confederation](Iroquois_Confederation "wikilink"), based in central and
western New York.[^59] After the [Beaver Wars](Beaver_Wars "wikilink")
in the mid-17th century, the Iroquois claimed much of the Ohio country
as hunting and, more importantly, beaver-trapping ground. After the
devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely
emptied the Ohio country of indigenous
people`{{dubious|date=January 2019}}`{=mediawiki} by the mid-to-late
17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly
[Algonquian](Algonquian_languages "wikilink"). Many of these
Ohio-country nations were multi-ethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic)
societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by
disease,`{{clarify|reason=no disease has been mentioned yet|date=January 2019}}`{=mediawiki}
war, and subsequent social instability. They subsisted on agriculture
([corn](maize "wikilink"), sunflowers, [beans](bean "wikilink"), etc.)
supplemented by seasonal hunts. By the 18th century, they were part of a
larger global economy brought about by European entry into the [fur
trade](fur_trade "wikilink").[^60]

Some of the indigenous nations which historically inhabited Ohio
included the Iroquoian,[^61] the Algonquian[^62] & the
Siouan.[^63][^64][^65] [Ohio country](Ohio_country "wikilink") was also
the site of Indian massacres, such as the [Yellow Creek
Massacre](Chief_Logan#Yellow_Creek_Massacre "wikilink"),
[Gnadenhutten](Gnadenhutten_massacre "wikilink") and [Pontiac\'s
Rebellion school
massacre](Pontiac's_Rebellion_school_massacre "wikilink").[^66] After
the [War of 1812](War_of_1812 "wikilink") when Natives suffered serious
losses such as at [Tippecanoe](Battle_of_Tippecanoe "wikilink"), most
Native tribes either left Ohio or had to live on only limited
reservations. By 1842, all remaining Natives were forced out of the
state.[^67]

```
During the 18th century, the
[French](French_colonisation_of_the_Americas "wikilink") set up a system
of [trading posts](trading_post "wikilink") to control the fur trade in
the region. Beginning in 1754, France and [Great
Britain](Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "wikilink") fought the [French and
Indian War](French_and_Indian_War "wikilink"). As a result of the
[Treaty of Paris](Treaty_of_Paris_(1763) "wikilink"), the French ceded
control of Ohio and the remainder of the [Old
Northwest](Old_Northwest "wikilink") to Great Britain. In the [Treaty of
Paris](Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) "wikilink") in 1783, Britain ceded all
claims to Ohio country to the United States.[^68][^69]

### Northwest Territory {#northwest_territory}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory}}
```
![The [Ohio Country](Ohio_Country "wikilink") indicating battle sites
between American settlers and indigenous tribes,
1775--1794](Ohio_Country_en.png "fig:The Ohio Country indicating battle sites between American settlers and indigenous tribes, 1775–1794")
The United States created the [Northwest
Territory](Northwest_Territory "wikilink") under the [Northwest
Ordinance](Northwest_Ordinance "wikilink") of 1787.[^70] [Slavery was
not permitted](Slave_states_and_free_states "wikilink") in the new
territory. Settlement began with the founding of
[Marietta](Marietta,_Ohio "wikilink") by the [Ohio Company of
Associates](Ohio_Company_of_Associates "wikilink"), which had been
formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. Following the
Ohio Company, the [Miami Company](Miami_Purchase "wikilink") (also
referred to as the \"[Symmes Purchase](Symmes_Purchase "wikilink")\")
claimed the southwestern section, and the [Connecticut Land
Company](Connecticut_Land_Company "wikilink") surveyed and settled the
[Connecticut Western Reserve](Connecticut_Western_Reserve "wikilink") in
present-day [Northeast Ohio](Northeast_Ohio "wikilink"). Territorial
surveyors from Fort Steuben began surveying an area of eastern Ohio
called the [Seven Ranges](Seven_Ranges "wikilink") at about the same
time.

The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously known
as [Ohio Country](Ohio_Country "wikilink") and [Illinois
Country](Illinois_Country "wikilink"). As Ohio prepared for statehood,
the [Indiana Territory](Indiana_Territory "wikilink") was created,
reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of
present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of the [Lower Peninsula of
Michigan](Lower_Peninsula_of_Michigan "wikilink") and the eastern tip of
the [Upper Peninsula](Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan "wikilink") and a
sliver of southeastern Indiana called \"The Gore\".

The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the [Western
Confederacy](Western_Confederacy "wikilink"), was forced to cede
extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the [Treaty
of Greenville](Treaty_of_Greenville "wikilink") in 1795.

Under the [Northwest Ordinance](Northwest_Ordinance "wikilink"), areas
could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached
60,000. Although Ohio\'s population was only 45,000 in December 1801,
[Congress](United_States_Congress "wikilink") determined that it was
growing rapidly and had already begun the path to statehood. In regards
to the [Leni Lenape](Leni_Lenape "wikilink") natives, Congress decided
that 10,000 acres on the [Muskingum River](Muskingum_River "wikilink")
in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property
thereof be vested in the [Moravian
Brethren](Moravian_Brethren "wikilink") \... or a society of the said
Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity\".[^71]

#### Rufus Putnam, the \"Father of Ohio\" {#rufus_putnam_the_father_of_ohio}

![[Rufus Putnam](Rufus_Putnam "wikilink") by James Sharples, Jr.,
1797](PUTNAM_exb.jpg "Rufus Putnam by James Sharples, Jr., 1797")

[Rufus Putnam](Rufus_Putnam "wikilink") served in important military
capacities in both the [French and Indian
War](French_and_Indian_War "wikilink") and the [American Revolutionary
War](American_Revolutionary_War "wikilink"). He was one of the most
highly respected men in the early years of the United States.[^72]

In 1776, Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications,
which enabled the [Continental Army](Continental_Army "wikilink") to
drive the British from Boston. [George
Washington](George_Washington "wikilink") was so impressed that he made
Putnam his chief engineer. After the war, Putnam and [Manasseh
Cutler](Manasseh_Cutler "wikilink") were instrumental in creating the
[Northwest Ordinance](Northwest_Ordinance "wikilink"), which opened up
the [Northwest Territory](Northwest_Territory "wikilink") for
settlement. This land was used to serve as compensation for what was
owed to Revolutionary War veterans. It was also at Putnam\'s
recommendation that the land would be surveyed and laid out in townships
of six miles square. Putnam organized and led the [Ohio Company of
Associates](Ohio_Company_of_Associates "wikilink"), who settled at
[Marietta, Ohio](Marietta,_Ohio "wikilink"), where they built a large
fort called [Campus
Martius](Campus_Martius_(Ohio) "wikilink").[^73][^74][^75]

Putnam, in the Puritan tradition, was influential in establishing
education in the Northwest Territory. Substantial amounts of land were
set aside for schools. Putnam had been one of the primary benefactors in
the founding of [Leicester Academy](Leicester_Academy "wikilink") in
Massachusetts, and similarly, in 1798, he created the plan for the
construction of the Muskingum Academy (now [Marietta
College](Marietta_College "wikilink")) in Ohio. In 1780, the directors
of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs
relating to settlement north of the Ohio River. In 1796, he was
commissioned by President George Washington as Surveyor-General of
United States Lands. In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest
Territory\'s first court. In 1802, he served in the convention to form a
constitution for the State of Ohio.[^76][^77][^78]

### Statehood and early years {#statehood_and_early_years}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}
```
On February 19, 1803, U.S. president [Thomas
Jefferson](Thomas_Jefferson "wikilink") signed an act of Congress that
approved Ohio\'s boundaries and constitution.[^79] However, Congress had
never passed a formal resolution admitting Ohio as the 17th state, a
custom not introduced until [Louisiana](Louisiana "wikilink")\'s
admission as the 18th state. Although no formal resolution of admission
was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, as Ohio began
preparations for celebrating its sesquicentennial, Ohio congressman
[George H. Bender](George_H._Bender "wikilink") introduced a bill in
Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the
date on which the [Ohio General
Assembly](Ohio_General_Assembly "wikilink") first convened.[^80] At a
special session at the old state capital in
[Chillicothe](Chillicothe,_Ohio "wikilink"), the Ohio state legislature
approved a new petition for statehood which was delivered to Washington,
D.C., on horseback, and approved that August.[^81][^82][^83]

Ohio has had three capital cities: Chillicothe,
[Zanesville](Zanesville,_Ohio "wikilink"), and
[Columbus](Columbus,_Ohio "wikilink"). Chillicothe was the capital from
1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years, as
part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital
was then moved back to Chillicothe, which was the capital from 1812 to
1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to have it near the
geographic center of the state.

Although many Native Americans had migrated west to evade American
encroachment, others remained settled in the state, sometimes
assimilating in part. In 1830 under President [Andrew
Jackson](Andrew_Jackson "wikilink"), the US government forced [Indian
Removal](Indian_Removal "wikilink") of most tribes to the [Indian
Territory](Indian_Territory "wikilink") west of the Mississippi River.

In 1835, Ohio fought with [Michigan](Michigan "wikilink") in the [Toledo
War](Toledo_War "wikilink"), a mostly bloodless boundary war over the
Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress
intervened, making Michigan\'s admittance as a state conditional on
ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo
Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the [Upper
Peninsula](Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan "wikilink"), in addition to the
eastern third which was already considered part of the state.

![25th U.S. president [William McKinley](William_McKinley "wikilink")
was from Ohio, one of six to be elected from the
state.](William_McKinley_by_Courtney_Art_Studio,_1896.jpg "25th U.S. president William McKinley was from Ohio, one of six to be elected from the state.")

### Civil War and growth {#civil_war_and_growth}

![The route of [Morgan\'s
Raid](Morgan's_Raid "wikilink").](Morganmap.jpg "The route of Morgan's Raid.")

Ohio\'s central position and its population gave it an important place
during the [Civil War](American_Civil_War "wikilink"). The Ohio River
was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio\'s
railroads. The industry of Ohio made the state one of the most important
states in the Union during the Civil war. Ohio contributed more soldiers
per-capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state\'s
morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the [Battle of
Shiloh](Battle_of_Shiloh "wikilink"), a costly victory in which Ohio
forces suffered 2,000 casualties.[^84] Later that year, when
[Confederate](Confederate_States_Army "wikilink") troops under the
leadership of [Stonewall Jackson](Stonewall_Jackson "wikilink")
threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor [David
Tod](David_Tod "wikilink") still could recruit 5,000 volunteers to
provide three months of service.[^85] From July 13 to 26, 1863, towns
along the Ohio River were attacked and ransacked in [Morgan\'s
Raid](Morgan's_Raid "wikilink"), starting in
[Harrison](Harrison,_Ohio "wikilink") in the west and culminating in the
[Battle of Salineville](Battle_of_Salineville "wikilink") near [West
Point](West_Point,_Columbiana_County,_Ohio "wikilink") in the far east.
While this raid was overall insignificant to the Confederacy, it aroused
fear among people in Ohio and [Indiana](Indiana "wikilink") as it was
the furthest advancement of troops from the South in the war.[^86]
Almost 35,000 Ohioans died in the conflict, and 30,000 were physically
wounded.[^87] By the end of the Civil War, the Union\'s top three
generals -- [Ulysses S. Grant](Ulysses_S._Grant "wikilink"), [William
Tecumseh Sherman](William_Tecumseh_Sherman "wikilink"), and [Philip
Sheridan](Philip_Sheridan "wikilink") -- were all from Ohio.[^88][^89]

### Industrialization

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Petroleum industry in Ohio}}
```
![The first [Standard Oil](Standard_Oil "wikilink") refinery was opened
in Cleveland by businessman [John D.
Rockefeller](John_D._Rockefeller "wikilink").](Standard_Oil.jpg "The first Standard Oil refinery was opened in Cleveland by businessman John D. Rockefeller.")

Throughout much of the 19th century, industry was rapidly introduced to
complement an existing agricultural economy. One of the first iron
manufacturing plants opened near
[Youngstown](Youngstown,_Ohio "wikilink") in 1804 called Hopewell
Furnace. By the mid-19th century, 48 blast furnaces were operating in
the state, most in the southern portions of the state.[^90] Discovery of
coal deposits aided the further development of the steel industry in the
state, and by 1853 Cleveland was the third largest iron and steel
producer in the country. The first [Bessemer
converter](Bessemer_converter "wikilink") was purchased by the
[Cleveland Rolling Mill Company](Cleveland_Rolling_Mill "wikilink"),
which eventually became part of the [U.S. Steel
Corporation](U.S._Steel_Corporation "wikilink") following the merger of
[Federal Steel Company](Federal_Steel_Company "wikilink") and [Carnegie
Steel](Carnegie_Steel "wikilink"), the first billion-dollar American
corporation.[^91] The first open-hearth furnace used for steel
production was constructed by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland, and
by 1892, Ohio ranked as the 2nd-largest steel producing state behind
Pennsylvania.[^92] [Republic Steel](Republic_Steel "wikilink") was
founded in Youngstown in 1899, and was at one point the nation\'s third
largest producer. [Armco](Armco "wikilink"), now AK Steel, was founded
in [Middletown](Middletown,_Ohio "wikilink") also in 1899.

### 20th century {#th_century}

![[Iron](Iron "wikilink") being converted to [steel](steel "wikilink")
for wartime efforts at Youngstown\'s [Republic
Steel](Republic_Steel "wikilink") in
1941.](A_scene_in_a_steel_mill,_Republic_Steel,_Youngstown,_Ohio.jpg "Iron being converted to steel for wartime efforts at Youngstown's Republic Steel in 1941.")

During the 1930s, the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression_in_the_United_States "wikilink") struck the
state hard. American Jews watched the rise of the [Third
Reich](Third_Reich "wikilink") with apprehension. Cleveland residents
[Jerry Siegel](Jerry_Siegel "wikilink") and [Joe
Shuster](Joe_Shuster "wikilink") created the
[Superman](Superman "wikilink") comic character in the spirit of the
Jewish [golem](golem "wikilink"). Many of their comics portrayed
Superman fighting and defeating the [Nazis](Nazis "wikilink").[^93][^94]

Artists, writers, musicians and actors developed in the state throughout
the 20th century and often moved to other cities which were larger
centers for their work. They included [Zane Grey](Zane_Grey "wikilink"),
[Milton Caniff](Milton_Caniff "wikilink"), [George
Bellows](George_Bellows "wikilink"), [Art Tatum](Art_Tatum "wikilink"),
[Roy Lichtenstein](Roy_Lichtenstein "wikilink"), and [Roy
Rogers](Roy_Rogers "wikilink"). [Alan Freed](Alan_Freed "wikilink"), who
emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live
rock \'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952. Famous filmmakers include
[Steven Spielberg](Steven_Spielberg "wikilink"), [Chris
Columbus](Chris_Columbus_(filmmaker) "wikilink") and the original
[Warner Brothers](Warner_Brothers "wikilink"), who set up their first
movie theatre in Youngstown before that company later relocated to
California. The state produced many popular musicians, including [Dean
Martin](Dean_Martin "wikilink"), [Doris Day](Doris_Day "wikilink"), [The
O\'Jays](The_O'Jays "wikilink"), [Marilyn
Manson](Marilyn_Manson "wikilink"), [Dave Grohl](Dave_Grohl "wikilink"),
[Devo](Devo "wikilink"), [Macy Gray](Macy_Gray "wikilink") and [The
Isley Brothers](The_Isley_Brothers "wikilink").

The [National Football League](National_Football_League "wikilink") was
originally founded in Ohio in 1920 as the American Professional Football
Association.

In 1970 an [Ohio Army National
Guard](Ohio_Army_National_Guard "wikilink") unit [fired at
students](Kent_State_shootings "wikilink") during an anti-war protest at
[Kent State University](Kent_State_University "wikilink"), killing four
and wounding nine. The Guard had been called onto campus after several
protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in
downtown Kent and the burning of an
[ROTC](Reserve_Officers'_Training_Corps "wikilink") building. The main
cause of the protests was the United States\' [invasion of
Cambodia](Cambodian_Campaign "wikilink") during the [Vietnam
War](Vietnam_War "wikilink").[^95]

Beginning in the 1980s, the state entered into international economic
and resource cooperation treaties and organizations with other
[Midwestern](Midwestern "wikilink") states, as well as [New
York](New_York_(state) "wikilink"),
[Pennsylvania](Pennsylvania "wikilink"), [Ontario](Ontario "wikilink"),
and [Quebec](Quebec "wikilink"), including the [Great Lakes
Charter](Great_Lakes_Charter "wikilink"), [Great Lakes
Compact](Great_Lakes_Compact "wikilink"), and the [Council of Great
Lakes Governors](Council_of_Great_Lakes_Governors "wikilink").

### 21st century {#st_century}

Ohio had become nicknamed the \"fuel cell corridor\"[^96] in being a
contributing anchor for the region now called the \"Green Belt,\" in
reference to the growing renewable energy sector.[^97] Although the
state experienced heavy manufacturing losses around the start of the
20th century and suffered from the [Great
Recession](Great_Recession "wikilink"), it was rebounding by the second
decade in being the country\'s 6th-fastest-growing economy through the
first half of 2010.[^98]

Ohio\'s transition into the 21st century was symbolized by the Third
Frontier program, spearheaded by Governor [Bob
Taft](Bob_Taft "wikilink") around the start of the 20th century. This
built on the agricultural and industrial pillars of the economy, dubbed
the first and second frontiers, by aiding the growth of advanced
technology industries, the third frontier.[^99] The results of this
initiative were considered widely successful,[^100] attracting 637 new
high-tech companies to the state and 55,000 new jobs, with an average of
salary of \$65,000,[^101] while having a \$6.6 billion economic impact
with an investment return ratio of 9:1.[^102] In 2010 the state won the
[International Economic Development
Council](International_Economic_Development_Council "wikilink")\'s
*Excellence in Economic Development Award*, celebrated as a national
model of success.[^103]

Many of the state\'s former industrial centers turned to new industries,
including [Akron](Akron,_Ohio "wikilink") as a center for polymer and
biomedical research, [Cincinnati](Cincinnati "wikilink") as the state\'s
largest mercantile hub,[^104] [Columbus](Columbus,_Ohio "wikilink") as a
center for technological research and development, education, and
insurance,[^105] [Cleveland](Cleveland,_Ohio "wikilink") in regenerative
medicine research and manufacturing, [Dayton](Dayton,_Ohio "wikilink")
as an aerospace and defense hub, and [Toledo](Toledo,_Ohio "wikilink")
as a national center for solar technology.[^106][^107] Ohio was hit hard
by the [Great Recession](Great_Recession "wikilink") and manufacturing
employment losses entering the 2010s. The recession cost the state
376,500 jobs[^108] and it had 89,053 foreclosures in 2009, a record for
the state.[^109] The median household income dropped 7% and the poverty
rate ballooned to 13.5% by 2009.[^110]

### Population

From just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio\'s population grew faster
than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the [1970
census](1970_United_States_Census "wikilink"), which recorded just over
10.65 million Ohioans.[^111] Growth then slowed for the next four
decades.[^112] The [United States Census
Bureau](United_States_Census_Bureau "wikilink") estimates that the
population of Ohio was 11,689,100 on July 1, 2019, a 1.32% increase
since the [2010 United States
Census](2010_United_States_Census "wikilink").[^113] Ohio\'s population
growth lags that of the entire United States, and
[whites](White_Americans "wikilink") are found in a greater density than
the US average. `{{As of|2000}}`{=mediawiki}, Ohio\'s [center of
population](center_of_population "wikilink") is located in [Morrow
County](Morrow_County,_Ohio "wikilink"),[^114] in the [county
seat](county_seat "wikilink") of [Mount
Gilead](Mount_Gilead,_Ohio "wikilink").[^115] This is approximately
`{{convert|6346|ft|m}}`{=mediawiki} south and west of Ohio\'s population
center in 1990.[^116] ![Graph of Ohio\'s population growth from 1800 to
2000](Population_Growth_Ohio.png "fig:Graph of Ohio's population growth from 1800 to 2000")

As of 2011, 27.6% of Ohio\'s children under the age of 1 belonged to
minority groups.[^117]

6.2% of Ohio\'s population is under five years of age, 23.7 percent
under 18 years of age, and 14.1 percent were 65 or older. Females made
up approximately 51.2 percent of the population.

## Transportation

### Ground travel {#ground_travel}

Many major east--west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of
those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market
Route 3\", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [Lincoln
Highway](Lincoln_Highway "wikilink") which was the first road across
America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln
Highway linked many towns and cities together, including
[Canton](Canton,_Ohio "wikilink"),
[Mansfield](Mansfield,_Ohio "wikilink"),
[Wooster](Wooster,_Ohio "wikilink"), [Lima](Lima,_Ohio "wikilink"), and
[Van Wert](Van_Wert,_Ohio "wikilink"). The arrival of the Lincoln
Highway to Ohio was a major influence on the development of the state.
Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the
Lincoln Highway through Ohio became [U.S. Route
30](U.S._Route_30_in_Ohio "wikilink").

Ohio also is home to `{{convert|228|mi|km|0}}`{=mediawiki} of the
Historic [National Road](National_Road "wikilink"), now [U.S. Route
40](U.S._Route_40_in_Ohio "wikilink").

Ohio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways.
Major east-west through routes include the [Ohio
Turnpike](Ohio_Turnpike "wikilink")
([I-80](Interstate_80_in_Ohio "wikilink")/[I-90](Interstate_90_in_Ohio "wikilink"))
in the north, [I-76](Interstate_76_in_Ohio "wikilink") through
[Akron](Akron,_Ohio "wikilink") to
[Pennsylvania](Pennsylvania "wikilink"),
[I-70](Interstate_70_in_Ohio "wikilink") through
[Columbus](Columbus,_Ohio "wikilink") and
[Dayton](Dayton,_Ohio "wikilink"), and the [Appalachian
Highway](Appalachian_Highway_(Ohio) "wikilink") ([State Route
32](Ohio_State_Route_32 "wikilink")) running from [West
Virginia](West_Virginia "wikilink") to
[Cincinnati](Cincinnati "wikilink"). Major north--south routes include
[I-75](Interstate_75_in_Ohio "wikilink") in the west through
[Toledo](Toledo,_Ohio "wikilink"), Dayton, and Cincinnati,
[I-71](Interstate_71 "wikilink") through the middle of the state from
[Cleveland](Cleveland "wikilink") through Columbus and Cincinnati into
[Kentucky](Kentucky "wikilink"), and
[I-77](Interstate_77_in_Ohio "wikilink") in the eastern part of the
state from Cleveland through Akron, [Canton](Canton,_Ohio "wikilink"),
[New Philadelphia](New_Philadelphia,_Ohio "wikilink") and
[Marietta](Marietta,_Ohio "wikilink") south into West Virginia.
Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of the heaviest
traveled sections of interstate in Ohio.

Ohio also has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes.
Many of them follow [rail trails](rail_trail "wikilink"), with
conversion ongoing. The [Ohio to Erie
Trail](Ohio_to_Erie_Trail "wikilink") (route 1) connects Cincinnati,
Columbus, and Cleveland. [U.S. Bicycle Route
50](U.S._Bicycle_Route_50 "wikilink") traverses Ohio from
[Steubenville](Steubenville,_Ohio "wikilink") to the Indiana state line
outside [Richmond](Richmond,_Indiana "wikilink").[^179]

Ohio has several long-distance hiking trails, the most prominent of
which is the [Buckeye Trail](Buckeye_Trail "wikilink") which extends
`{{convert|1444|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} in a loop around the
state of Ohio. Part of it is on roads and part is on wooded trail.
Additionally, the [North Country Trail](North_Country_Trail "wikilink")
(the longest of the eleven [National Scenic
Trails](National_Scenic_Trail "wikilink") authorized by
[Congress](United_States_Congress "wikilink")) and the [American
Discovery Trail](American_Discovery_Trail "wikilink") (a system of
recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast
route across the mid-tier of the [United
States](United_States "wikilink")) pass through Ohio. Much of these two
trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail.

Ohio has extensive railroads, though today most are only utilized by
freight companies. Major cities in the north and south of Ohio lie on
[Amtrak](Amtrak "wikilink") intercity rail lines. The *[Capitol
Limited](Capitol_Limited "wikilink")* and the *[Lake Shore
Limited](Lake_Shore_Limited "wikilink")* serve Toledo, Cleveland and
other northern Ohio cities. The
*[Cardinal](Cardinal_(train) "wikilink")* serves Cincinnati. Columbus is
the [largest city in the United
States](List_of_major_cities_in_U.S._lacking_inter-city_rail_service "wikilink")
without any form of passenger rail. Its [Union
Station](Union_Station_(Columbus,_Ohio) "wikilink") last had an
inter-city train in 1979 with the *[National
Limited](National_Limited_(Amtrak_train) "wikilink").* Mass transit
exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems,
though Cleveland has light and heavy rail through the
[GCRTA](GCRTA "wikilink"), and Cincinnati reestablished a [streetcar
line](Cincinnati_Bell_Connector "wikilink") in 2016.

### Air travel {#air_travel}

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|List of airports in Ohio}}
```
Ohio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military.
The four international include [Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport](Cleveland_Hopkins_International_Airport "wikilink"), [John
Glenn Columbus International
Airport](John_Glenn_Columbus_International_Airport "wikilink"), [Dayton
International Airport](Dayton_International_Airport "wikilink"), and
[Rickenbacker International
Airport](Rickenbacker_International_Airport "wikilink") (one of two
military airfields). The other military airfield is [Wright Patterson
Air Force Base](Wright_Patterson_Air_Force_Base "wikilink") which is one
of the largest Air Force bases in the United States. Other major
airports are located in [Toledo](Toledo_Express_Airport "wikilink") and
[Akron](Akron-Canton_Airport "wikilink"). Cincinnati\'s primary airport,
[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International
Airport](Cincinnati/Northern_Kentucky_International_Airport "wikilink"),
is in [Hebron, Kentucky](Hebron,_Kentucky "wikilink"), and therefore is
not included in Ohio airport lists.

[Republican Party](Republican_Party_(United_States) "wikilink").[^184] A
[lieutenant governor](Lieutenant_Governor_of_Ohio "wikilink") succeeds
the governor in the event of any removal from office, and performs any
duties assigned by the governor.[^185][^186] The current lieutenant
governor is [Jon A. Husted](Jon_A._Husted "wikilink"). The other elected
constitutional offices in the executive branch are the [secretary of
state](Ohio_Secretary_of_State "wikilink") ([Frank
LaRose](Frank_LaRose "wikilink")),
[auditor](Ohio_State_Auditor "wikilink") ([Keith
Faber](Keith_Faber "wikilink")),

departments in the executive branch.[^188][^189]

### Legislative branch {#legislative_branch}

The [Ohio General Assembly](Ohio_General_Assembly "wikilink") is a
[bicameral](bicameral "wikilink") legislature consisting of the

senator. Each senator represents approximately 330,000
[constituents](Electoral_district "wikilink").[^191] The House of
Representatives is composed of 99 members.[^192] The [Republican
Party](Republican_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") is the controlling
party in both houses as of the [2020 election
cycle](2020_Ohio_elections "wikilink").

### Judicial branch {#judicial_branch}

Center](Thomas_J._Moyer_Ohio_Judicial_Center "wikilink") holds the
[Supreme Court of
Ohio](Supreme_Court_of_Ohio "wikilink").](File:Ohio_State_Office_Building_1.jpg "wikilink")
There are three levels of the Ohio state
[judiciary](judiciary "wikilink"). The lowest level is the court of
common pleas: each county maintains its own constitutionally mandated
court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over \"all
justiciable matters\".[^193] The intermediate-level court system is the
district court system.[^194] Twelve courts of appeals exist, each
retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and
county courts in a set geographical area.[^195] A case heard in this
system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is
elected.[^196]

The state\'s highest-ranking court is the [Ohio Supreme
Court](Ohio_Supreme_Court "wikilink").[^197] A seven-justice panel
composes the court, which, by its own
[discretion](Certiorari#State_courts "wikilink"), hears appeals from the
courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited
matters.[^198]

### \"Mother of presidents\" {#mother_of_presidents}

Six U.S. presidents hailed from Ohio at the time of their elections,
giving rise to its nickname \"mother of presidents\", a sobriquet it
shares with [Virginia](Virginia "wikilink"). It is also termed \"modern
mother of presidents\",[^199] in contrast to Virginia\'s status as the
origin of presidents earlier in American history. Seven presidents were
born in Ohio, making it second to Virginia\'s eight. Virginia-born
[William Henry Harrison](William_Henry_Harrison "wikilink") lived most
of his life in Ohio and is also buried there. Harrison conducted his
political career while living on the family compound, founded by his
father-in-law, [John Cleves Symmes](John_Cleves_Symmes "wikilink"), in
[North Bend, Ohio](North_Bend,_Ohio "wikilink"). The seven presidents
born in Ohio were [Ulysses S. Grant](Ulysses_S._Grant "wikilink")
(elected from [Illinois](Illinois "wikilink")), [Rutherford B.
Hayes](Rutherford_B._Hayes "wikilink"), [James A.
Garfield](James_A._Garfield "wikilink"), [Benjamin
Harrison](Benjamin_Harrison "wikilink") (grandson of William Henry
Harrison & elected from [Indiana](Indiana "wikilink")), [William
McKinley](William_McKinley "wikilink"), [William Howard
Taft](William_Howard_Taft "wikilink") and [Warren G.
Harding](Warren_G._Harding "wikilink").[^200] All seven were
[Republicans](History_of_the_United_States_Republican_Party "wikilink").

### Swing state {#swing_state}

![[Presidential election
results](2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Ohio "wikilink") by
county for 2020.
`{{leftlegend|#4389E3|Democratic}}`{=mediawiki}`{{leftlegend|#AA0000|Republican}}`{=mediawiki}](Ohio_Presidential_Election_Results_2020.svg "Presidential election results by county for 2020. ")

Ohio is considered a [swing state](swing_state "wikilink"), being won by
either the [Democratic](Democratic_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") or
[Republican](Republican_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") candidates
reasonably each election. As a swing state, Ohio is usually targeted by
both major-party campaigns, especially in competitive elections.[^201]
Pivotal in the election of
[1888](1888_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink"), Ohio has
been a regular swing state since 1980.[^202][^203]

Additionally, Ohio is considered a [bellwether](bellwether "wikilink").
Historian R. Douglas Hurt asserts that not since Virginia \"had a state
made such a mark on national political affairs\".[^204] *[The
Economist](The_Economist "wikilink")* notes that \"This slice of the
mid-west contains a bit of everything American---part north-eastern and
part southern, part urban and part rural, part hardscrabble poverty and
part booming suburb\",[^205] Since
[1896](1896_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink"), Ohio has
had only three misses in the general election ([Thomas E. Dewey in
1944](1944_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink"), [Richard
Nixon in 1960](1960_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink"), and
[Donald Trump in
2020](2020_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink")) and had the
longest perfect streak of any state, voting for the winning presidential
candidate in each election from
[1964](1964_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink") to
[2016](2016_United_States_presidential_election "wikilink"), and in 33
of the 38 held since the [Civil War](American_Civil_War "wikilink"). No
Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio.

As of 2019, there are more than 7.8 million registered Ohioan voters,
with 1.3 million [Democrats](Ohio_Democratic_Party "wikilink") and
1.9 million [Republicans](Ohio_Republican_Party "wikilink"). They are
disproportionate in age, with a million more over 65 than there are 18-
to 24-year-olds.[^206] Since the [2010 midterm
elections](2010_United_States_elections "wikilink"), Ohio\'s voter
demographic has leaned towards the Republican Party.[^207] The governor,
[Mike DeWine](Mike_DeWine "wikilink"), is Republican, as well as all
other non-judicial statewide elected officials, including Lieutenant
Governor [Jon A. Husted](Jon_A._Husted "wikilink"), Attorney General
[Dave Yost](Dave_Yost "wikilink"), State Auditor [Keith
Faber](Keith_Faber "wikilink"), Secretary of State [Frank
LaRose](Frank_LaRose "wikilink") and State Treasurer [Robert
Sprague](Robert_Sprague "wikilink"). In the [Ohio State
Senate](Ohio_State_Senate "wikilink") the Republicans are the majority,
25--8, and in the [Ohio House of
Representatives](Ohio_House_of_Representatives "wikilink") the
Republicans control the delegation 64--35.

Losing two seats in the [U.S. House of
Representatives](U.S._House_of_Representatives "wikilink") following the
2010 Census, Ohio has had 16 seats for the three presidential elections
of the decade in 2012, 2016 and 2020.[^208] As of the [2020
cycle](2020_Ohio_elections "wikilink"), twelve federal representatives
are Republicans while four are Democrats. [Marcy
Kaptur](Marcia_Kaptur "wikilink")
(D-[09](Ohio's_9th_congressional_district "wikilink")) is the most
senior member of the Ohio delegation to the U.S. House of
Representatives.[^209] The
[senior](Seniority_in_the_United_States_Senate "wikilink") [U.S.
senator](United_States_Senator "wikilink"), [Sherrod
Brown](Sherrod_Brown "wikilink"), is a Democrat, while the junior, [Rob
Portman](Rob_Portman "wikilink"), is a Republican.[^210][^211]

### Voter suppression {#voter_suppression}

Since 1994, the state has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from
its rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy
on the grounds that it violated the [National Voter Registration Act
(NVRA) of
1993](National_Voter_Registration_Act_of_1993 "wikilink")[^212] and the
[Help America Vote Act of
2002](Help_America_Vote_Act_of_2002 "wikilink").[^213] In June, the
federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a
preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election.
The preliminary injunction was upheld in September by the Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Had it not been upheld, thousands of
voters would have been purged from the rolls just a few weeks before the
election.[^214]

Still, it has been estimated that the state has removed up to two
million voters since 2011.[^215]

## Education

Ohio\'s system of [public education](public_education "wikilink") is
outlined in Article VI of the [state
constitution](Ohio_Constitution "wikilink"), and in Title XXXIII of the
[Ohio Revised Code](Ohio_Revised_Code "wikilink"). [Ohio
University](Ohio_University "wikilink"), the first university in the
[Northwest Territory](Northwest_Territory "wikilink"), was also the
first public institution in Ohio. Substantively, Ohio\'s system is
similar to those found in [other
states](Education_in_the_United_States "wikilink"). At the State level,
the Ohio Department of Education, which is overseen by the [Ohio State
Board of Education](Ohio_State_Board_of_Education "wikilink"), governs
primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level,
there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The [Ohio Board
of Regents](Ohio_Board_of_Regents "wikilink") coordinates and assists
with Ohio\'s institutions of higher education which have recently been
reorganized into the [University System of
Ohio](University_System_of_Ohio "wikilink") under Governor Strickland.
The system averages an annual enrollment of more than 400,000 students,
making it one of the five largest state university systems in the U.S.

### Libraries

Ohio is home to some of the nation\'s highest-ranked public
libraries.[^217] The [2008 study by Thomas J. Hennen
Jr.](Hennen's_American_Public_Library_Ratings "wikilink") ranked Ohio as
number one in a state-by-state comparison.[^218] For 2008, 31 of Ohio\'s
library systems were all ranked in the top ten for American cities of
their population category.[^219]

access to high-quality, subscription research databases.

Ohio also offers the [OhioLINK](OhioLINK "wikilink") program, allowing
Ohio\'s libraries (particularly those from colleges and universities)
access to materials for the other libraries. The program is largely
successful in allowing researchers for access to books and other media
that might not be otherwise available.

Ohio is home to eight professional sports teams across the five
different [major
leagues](Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada "wikilink")
in the United States. Current teams include the [Cincinnati
Reds](Cincinnati_Reds "wikilink") and [Cleveland
Indians](Cleveland_Indians "wikilink") of [Major League
Baseball](Major_League_Baseball "wikilink"),[^226][^227] the [Columbus

League](National_Football_League "wikilink"),[^230] and the [Columbus
Blue Jackets](Columbus_Blue_Jackets "wikilink") of the [National Hockey
League](National_Hockey_League "wikilink").[^231]

Ohio has brought home seven [World Series](World_Series "wikilink")
titles (Reds [1919](1919_World_Series "wikilink"),
[1940](1940_World_Series "wikilink"),
[1975](1975_World_Series "wikilink"),
[1976](1976_World_Series "wikilink"),
[1990](1990_World_Series "wikilink"); Indians

[2020](MLS_Cup_2020 "wikilink")), one [NBA
Championship](NBA_Finals "wikilink") (Cavaliers
[2016](2016_NBA_Finals "wikilink")), and nine [NFL
Championships](History_of_the_National_Football_League_championship "wikilink")
([Pros 1920](1920_Akron_Pros_season "wikilink"); [Bulldogs
1922](1922_Canton_Bulldogs_season "wikilink"),

the [NFL](NFL "wikilink") in the first half of the 20th century, no Ohio
team has won the [Super Bowl](Super_Bowl "wikilink") since its inception
in [1967](Super_Bowl_I "wikilink") or made an appearance since

Ohio played a central role in the development of both Major League
Baseball and the National Football League. Baseball\'s first fully
professional team, the [Cincinnati Red
Stockings](Cincinnati_Red_Stockings "wikilink") of 1869, were organized
in Ohio.[^232] An informal early-20th-century American football
association, the [Ohio League](Ohio_League "wikilink"), was the direct
predecessor of the NFL, although neither of Ohio\'s modern NFL
franchises trace their roots to an Ohio League club. The [Pro Football
Hall of Fame](Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink") is located in
[Canton](Canton,_Ohio "wikilink").

On a smaller scale, Ohio hosts [minor league
baseball](minor_league_baseball "wikilink"), [arena
football](arena_football "wikilink"), [indoor
football](indoor_American_football "wikilink"), mid-level hockey, and
lower division soccer.

game has been played in southwest Ohio every year since 1888, and is the
oldest current non-conference [NCAA football](NCAA_football "wikilink")
rivalry.
